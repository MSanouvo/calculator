# calculator

This is a calculator app I put together using all of my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This app works as a basic calculator would. You insert a number, choose an opertor, and choose another number before pressing enter a receiving a result. After calculating, you can edit the current answer and calculate on that as well. Press clear to reset everything.

The CSS is pretty basic, using flexbox properties. The design could be improved on (to address in improvements), but as of now it is passable and follows a basic, intuitive layout.

As a whole, this took a few days of work, maybe around 12 hours of coding. The hardest parts were mainly the CSS to make the layout look a certain way, as well as getting the ball rolling on writing all of the code. Overall, I am a lot more comfortable writing basic code and putting it all together. I think some of my approach to this may have involved some sub-optimal coding standards that I would like to come back to and fix later.

Possible Improvements:
- Fix the CSS, go over a more thoughtout design and better implement it.
- Add more functionality, such as allowing users to backspace their number inputs
- Add more operators and functions that more advanced calculators might have
- Refactor my javascript to be easier to understand and less redundant
- Make the calculator larger and scalable
